This Scandinavian living room is arranged along the length of the narrow space, with a light gray fabric sofa positioned against one long side and a slim, rectangular oak coffee table centered directly in front of it. Opposite the sofa, a low white media console in a matte finish runs along the wall line, with a small, pale wood tripod floor lamp standing next to it near one end. At the far end of the room, a compact round dining table in white laminate with natural wood legs is paired with two simple molded plastic chairs in a muted pastel tone, facing each other to maximize the walkway. Near the entrance end, a slender open metal-and-wood shelving unit stands in the corner, and a small upholstered accent chair in a soft citrus color is placed beside the sofa, angled slightly toward the coffee table to create an energetic, conversational seating nook.
This mid-century modern living room features a low-profile, olive-green fabric sofa with tapered walnut legs positioned centrally, facing a long walnut media console that holds a flat-screen TV, a small ceramic planter with a trailing plant, and a woven storage basket on one end. In front of the sofa sits a rectangular walnut coffee table with softly rounded corners, styled with a stoneware vase containing dried grasses and a stack of two hardcover books, while a pair of tan leather sling armchairs with black metal frames are angled toward the coffee table on the right side, creating a casual conversation area. A compact, round side table with a walnut top and black metal base stands next to one armchair, holding a small terracotta pot with a succulent, and on the opposite end of the sofa a slender tripod floor lamp with a natural linen drum shade provides warm ambient light. In the far corner, a tall, leafy potted plant in a textured clay planter is placed beside a narrow walnut bookshelf that holds a mix of books, woven storage boxes, and a few small ceramic objects in earthy tones. A woven rattan lounge chair with a low back is set diagonally near the bookshelf with a folded moss-green throw draped over its arm, and a portable Bluetooth speaker in a muted charcoal finish rests on a small, minimalist stool-style side table nearby, completing the natural and earthy feel of the living room.
